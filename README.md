# Face-detection-with-Raspberrypi-intel-Openvino-and-intel-Neural-Compute-Stick
This is a quick project to implement intel Openvino on raspberry pi and use a camera to record video with opencv and perform inference with intel Neural Compute stick 2

To run the file just run python3 app-fps.py and it will capture a 10s video at 5 fps and will perform face detection using a pre-trained face-detection-adas-0001 model.
